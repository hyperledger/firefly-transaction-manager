# Expectations of Maintainers

Maintainers are expected to regularly:

- Make contributions to FireFly code repositories including code or documentation
- Review pull requests
- Investigate open GitHub issues
- Participate in Community Calls

# Becoming a Maintainer

The FireFly Project welcomes and encourages people to become maintainers of the project if they are interested and meet the following criteria:

## Criteria for becoming a member

- Expressed interest and commitment to meet the expectations of a maintainer for at least 6 months
- A consistent track record of contributions to FireFly code repositories which could be:
  - Enhancements
  - Bug fixes
  - Tests
  - Documentation
- A consistent track record of helpful code reviews on FireFly code repositories
- Regular participation in Community Calls
- A demonstrated interest and aptitude in thought leadership within the FireFly Project
- Sponsorship from an existing maintainer

There is no specific quantity of contributions or pull requests, or a specific time period over which the candidate must prove their track record. This will be left up to the discretion of the existing maintainers.

## Process for becoming a maintainer

Once the above criteria have been met, the sponsoring maintainer shall propose the addition of the new maintainer at a public Community Call. Existing maintainers shall vote at the next public Community Call whether the new maintainer should be added or not. Proxy votes may be submitted via email _before_ the meeting. A simple majority of the existing maintainers is required for the vote to pass.

## Maintainer resignation

While maintainers are expected in good faith to be committed to the project for a significant period of time, they are under no binding obligation to do so. Maintainers may resign at any time for any reason. If a maintainer wishes to resign they shall open a pull request to update the maintainers list removing themselves from the list.

## Maintainer inactivity

If a maintainer has remained inactive (not meeting the expectations of a maintainer) for a period of time (at least several months), an email should be sent to that maintainer noting their inactivity and asking if they still wish to be a maintainer. If they continue to be inactive after being notified via email, an existing maintainer may propose to remove the inactive maintainer at a public Community Call. Existing maintainers shall vote at the next public Community Call whether the inactive maintainer should be removed or not. Proxy votes may be submitted via email _before_ the meeting. A simple majority of the existing maintainers is required for the vote to pass.
